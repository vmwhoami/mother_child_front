## Mother and Child Hospital

In this project, I developed a frontend web application, Book a doctor appointment using Book a doctor appointment API - [Repo](https://github.com/vmwhoami/mother_child_api) also developed by me. One of the requirements for my final capstone project was to consume the data using React Application.

The application features include:

- A proper Authentication for Login and Registration page that requires authentication using JWT
- Listing of all Doctors
- The user can make an appointment with a specific Doctor
- The user can access a list of his appointments.
- The user can cancel the appointment.
